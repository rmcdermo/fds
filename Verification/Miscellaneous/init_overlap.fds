&HEAD CHID='init_overlap'/

 All concentrations etc. are completely fabricated.

 This is a verifiaction test case for the overlapping of INIT regions.
 The intended behavior is only specified quantities are updated for each
 line. Overlapping sections are first come first server; however, an
 INIT which partially overlaps with a previous INIT will still take
 effect in the unique cells.
